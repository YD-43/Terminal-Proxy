# Terminal-Proxy
python proxy checker to run in a seperate window, or in current command prompt or terminal.

# Current features:
Check single proxy  
Check proxy list  
save working proxies to "working-<filename>"  
more coming soon  
  
I will update this proxy checker whenever i have the time to.

# How to Use
run the "T-Proxy.exe" in either command prompt or standalone.  
  
``C:\Users\xx\Desktop>T-proxy.exe``

or click the exe by itself.

if you get the screen above, dont panic. This screen only shows if you 1) did not copy/clone over the config.json file or 2) config.json is not found in the same directory as T-Proxy.exe  
once you press enter, you should get a screen like below. It will repeat twice, and then terminate. Run the exe once more to get the terminal.
